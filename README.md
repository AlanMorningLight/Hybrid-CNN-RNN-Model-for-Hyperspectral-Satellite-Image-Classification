# Hybrid CNN-RNN Model for Hyperspectral Satellite Image Classification
The following model uses hybrid CNN- RNN model for classification of each pixel to its corresponding classes. Further the code is developed to classify pixels in accordance with soft as well as hard classification techniques.<br>
<b>1.) HARD CLASSIFICATION :</b> A pixel strictly belongs to a single class. <br>
<b>2.) SOFT CLASSIFICATION :</b> A pixel may belong to more than one class based on its membership value. <br>

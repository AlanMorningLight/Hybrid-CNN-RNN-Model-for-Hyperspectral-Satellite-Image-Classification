# Hybrid CNN-RNN Model for Hyperspectral Satellite Image Classification
Satellite image processing is one of the key research areas in the area of remote sensing. In hyperspectral satellite imaging information from across a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum is collected by satellites. The goal of Remote Sensing is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of terrain analysis and generation, topographic mapping. <br>

Traditional statistical approaches provides reasonable success in this field, but the efficiency is limited with respect to the robustness of results. The statistical approaches are parametric, based on an assumed statistical distribution and hence the efficiency and correctness of results closely correlates to the proximity of data to the assumed distribution. Today advancements in artificial intelligence have made autonomous, large scale analysis of imagery possible, now AI can be taught to process Satellite Imagery with a small degree of error. <br>

In the following model we use hybrid CNN- RNN model for classification of each pixel to its corresponding classes. Further the code is developed to classify pixels in accordance with soft as well as hard classification techniques.<br>
<b>1.) HARD CLASSIFICATION :</b> A pixel strictly belongs to a single class. <br>
<b>2.) SOFT CLASSIFICATION :</b> A pixel may belong to more than one class based on its membership value. <br>

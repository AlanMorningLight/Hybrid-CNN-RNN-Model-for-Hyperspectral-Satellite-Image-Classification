# Hybrid-CNN-RNN-Model-for-Hyperspectral-Satellite-Image-Classification
The following model uses hybrid CNN- RNN model for classification of each pixel to its corresponding classes. Further the code is developed to classify pixels in accordance with soft as well as hard classification techniques.
1.) HARD CLASSIFICATION : A pixel strictly belongs to a single class. 
2.) SOFT CLASSIFICATION : A pixel may belong to more than one class based on its membership value.
